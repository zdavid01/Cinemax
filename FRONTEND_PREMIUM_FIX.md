# ðŸ”§ Premium Access Fix

## The Issue
Your user is premium in the backend, but the frontend has an old session cached that doesn't have `isPremium: true`.

## Quick Fix - Clear Session and Login Again

### Option 1: Use Logout Button (Recommended)
1. Go to: http://localhost:4200/logout
2. Wait for logout to complete
3. Go to: http://localhost:4200/login
4. Login with:
   - Username: `testuser`
   - Password: `Test@1234`
5. You should now see the gold "My Drive Movies" button!

### Option 2: Clear Browser Storage Manually
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Under **Local Storage** â†’ `http://localhost:4200`
4. Delete the `appState` key
5. Refresh the page
6. Login again

### Option 3: Clear All and Start Fresh
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

Then login again at http://localhost:4200/login

## How to Verify It's Working

After logging in, open the browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
Premium Guard - isPremium: true
âœ… Premium access granted
```

When you navigate to `/sessions`, you should see:
- âœ… The guard allows access
- âœ… Movies load from Google Drive
- âœ… No redirect to /premium

## Check Your Premium Status

You can verify your premium status by checking the navbar:
- **Premium Users**: See gold "My Drive Movies" button in navbar
- **Non-Premium Users**: Don't see this button, see "Go Premium" in menu instead

## Backend Status
Your backend user is confirmed premium:
```json
{
  "isPremium": true
}
```

The JWT token also includes:
```
"IsPremium": "true"
```

So the backend is correct - you just need to refresh the frontend session!
